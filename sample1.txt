Okay text me something with proper English
What do you mean?
Like what?
I am doing a project on sentence analysis
So I need a large dataset
Chat dataset
Okay
Do you know an imperative sentence?
I knew it...I don't remember now.
Imperative sentences are those which involve any requests or orders.
Bring my the pendrive tomorrow.
meet me tomorrow at the round table.
That's neither a request nor an order.
Add please to both the sentences.
Yup.
Then please request.
Sorry can you add please to both the sentences?
Got it.
What should I do now?
Hmm.. So imperative sentences should not necessarily be a request or an order but it should result in some action.
While you text me add some imperative sentence.
So how are you sanju?
I am fine Vivek.
How about you?
So to keep this conversation interesting tell me about your life in Nigeria.
How do I get imperative there?
I can't use that in past tense.
That's okay.
Ok...
Remind me to bring bluetooth module through whatsapp
But why do you need this?
I didn't get you.
Okay let me explain to you what machine learning is.
Okay
Machine learning is a new technology
If we give it a bunch of sentence and tell few of them is imperative
The machine automatically learns to tell whether the new sentence is imperative or not
First of all..
It's sentence..
Not sentence
Oh okay I have to careful with spellings?
Did you get what machine learning does?
Okay...now I got you..
Yes I did ya.
I will give you credit if this helps me out
Ohohoo
You should start with a conversation.
I am very poor at conversing especially with girls
Could you please start the conversation?
Please
You are far better now..
This is a big bug 
Thanks I found one
Huh?
Well earlier I was hesitant because I didn't know how to react with a girl
What did you people feel about me then ?
Forget this
Sanju you there?
Chill
Were you in boys school?
Yes
My wifi keeps going and not coming
I totally felt you were a nerd a shy guy who doesn't talk to girls just into books all the time.
By the way you are a nerd.
Seriously?
Yup
Nope I am not nerd
Okay leave.
Okay I agree I am a nerd to some extent
Extinct means dead
So why do you need this now?
By the way did you give 400 rs to csi?
Today I had not got the money. So I'll pay tomorrow.
I was writing code to do this classification

Will you be able to get the money or not?
Yup I 'll bring.
