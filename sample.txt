Hello.
This is a sample text file for the sample summarizer.
This is to make sure if the sample code works.
For example, if this file includes text such as, "Please get the pendrive tomorrow", this will cause an output to happen.
If there are multiple lines with please, this has to differentiate between imperative sentences and textual information.
But this is not there yet.
Can you complete the summarizer by tomorrow please?
Well, since you asked nicely, I will.
